## 🕹️ Tap The Ball Game – Flutter README
This is a simple and fun Flutter game where players must tap a moving ball as many times as possible before the timer runs out. It’s a great beginner project to learn about Flutter widgets, timers, gestures, and basic game logic.

## 📱 Features
- Simple and interactive gameplay
- Countdown timer and scoring system
- Random ball movement
- Game Over dialog with replay option
- Smooth UI built with Flutter’s widget system
  
## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the app on your system.
1. **Install Flutter**
   - Follow the official installation guide: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

2. **Create a new Flutter project**
   ```bash
   flutter create tap_the_ball_game
   ```

3. Replace the **lib folder** with the code provided in this tutorial.

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
## 📂 Project Structure

│   └── screens/

└── README.md                    → Project documentation
```


## 🧠 How It Works
The app uses Flutter’s `setState()` and `Timer` to update the ball’s position randomly at each tap. The user earns 1 point per successful tap. The timer runs for 30 seconds, and at the end, a dialog shows the total score with an option to play again.

## 🎨 Future Improvements
- Add sound effects for each tap.
- Add different levels or difficulty modes.
- Animate ball movement for smoother gameplay.
- Store and display the highest score using SharedPreferences.
- Add background music and colorful themes.
